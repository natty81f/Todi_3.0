A digital diary for busy people.

This app is based upon the idea that people love to record their daily lives but don't necessarily have the time or desire to write a novel or blog post about it.

Simple and quick, almost intuitive way for people to write about their daily musings, experiences and mood. A sort of digital diary for the busy modern world.
